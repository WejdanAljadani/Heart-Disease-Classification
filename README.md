# Heart-Disease-Classification

<h1>Summary of the project </h1>
This project built for classifying the heart disease and I bulit two ML models to decide which model is better for our problem.
In this project I followed five steps to get on the results as following, data gathering,data exploration,data visualization,data preprocessing,build the models and evaluate it,and finally,select the best model.

<h1>Results </h1>
In the end, I decided to choose the LinearSVC as the best model ,because our problem it's critical case and we want to get on a small false negative value,and based on our results the LinearSVC has a false negative value 12% compared to the false negative of LogisticRegression it is 16%.
